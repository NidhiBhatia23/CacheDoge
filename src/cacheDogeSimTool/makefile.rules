##############################################################

###### Place all generic definitions here ######

# This defines tests which run tools of the same name.  This is simply for convenience to avoid
# defining the test name twice (once in TOOL_ROOTS and again in TEST_ROOTS).
# Tests defined here should not be defined in TOOL_ROOTS and TEST_ROOTS.
TEST_TOOL_ROOTS := MyPinTool

# This defines the tests to be run that were not already defined in TEST_TOOL_ROOTS.
TEST_ROOTS :=

# This defines the tools which will be run during the the tests, and were not already defined in
# TEST_TOOL_ROOTS.
TOOL_ROOTS :=

# This defines the static analysis tools which will be run during the the tests. They should not
# be defined in TEST_TOOL_ROOTS. If a test with the same name exists, it should be defined in
# TEST_ROOTS.
# Note: Static analysis tools are in fact executables linked with the Pin Static Analysis Library.
# This library provides a subset of the Pin APIs which allows the tool to perform static analysis
# of an application or dll. Pin itself is not used when this tool runs.
SA_TOOL_ROOTS :=

# This defines all the applications that will be run during the tests.
APP_ROOTS :=

# This defines any additional object files that need to be compiled.
OBJECT_ROOTS :=

# This defines any additional dlls (shared objects), other than the pintools, that need to be compiled.
DLL_ROOTS :=

# This defines any static libraries (archives), that need to be built.
LIB_ROOTS :=

###### Define the sanity subset ######

# This defines the list of tests that should run in sanity. It should include all the tests listed in
# TEST_TOOL_ROOTS and TEST_ROOTS excluding only unstable tests.
SANITY_SUBSET := $(TEST_TOOL_ROOTS) $(TEST_ROOTS)

# Test recipes
#
##############################################################

# This section contains recipes for tests other than the default.
# See makefile.default.rules for the default test rules.
# All tests in this section should adhere to the naming convention: <testname>.test


##############################################################
#
# Build rules
#
##############################################################

# This section contains the build rules for all binaries that have special build rules.
# See makefile.default.rules for the default build rules.

#PIN_ROOT: Specify the location for the Pin kit when building a tool outside of the kit. 
#CC: Override the default c compiler for tools. 
#CXX: Override the default c++ compiler for tools 
#APP_CC: Override the default c compiler for applications. If not defined, APP_CC will be the same as CC. 
#APP_CXX: Override the default c++ compiler for applications. If not defined, APP_CXX will be the same as CXX. 
#TARGET: Override the default target architecture e.g. for cross-compilation. 
#ICC: Specify ICC=1 when building tools with the Intel Compiler. 
#DEBUG: When DEBUG=1 is specified, debug information will be generated when building tools and applications. Also, no compilation and/or link optimizations will be performed.
